&lt;p>A friend of mine recently finished his sentance at a facility that
allowed them to purchase the &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jpay-introduces-the-jp5mini-a-highly-customized-android-tablet-for-inmates-300110638.html">JP5 Mini&lt;/a> tablet for use while incarcerated. After his release, JPay removed the
in-facility restrictions and allowed them to retain the media they purchased from
JPay over the course of their sentancing. However, due to the conditions of
their release, they are unable to operate such electronic devices. They still wanted to keep their purchased media, so I figured I would try my hand.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-problem">The Problem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The JP5 Mini uses a custom fork of Android 4.2.2 (release date: 2012).
This custom version of Android contains a lot of security features that
prevent tampering from inmates. So no opening up the build version and
enabling developer settings. No ADB capabilities. No mounting for file
system access over USB. The tablet does have what appears to be a small
storage module soldered to the board where I think the SD card reader
would be. This prevents inmates from swapping cards and eliminates a
potential attack vector for hacking. So no just popping it open either.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-solution">The Solution&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Luckily, this version of Android DOES allow for APK installation. APKs
are Android applications. Think of them like a Windows .exe. There are
lots of websites that host APK files too for you to download. We need
an APK that runs an FTP server on the tablet.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-apk">The APK&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The built in broswer is pretty difficult to use given the size and
resolution the built in screen has. However, it&amp;rsquo;s what we need to use.
I used &lt;a href="https://ftp-server-ultimate.apk.gold/android-4.2.2">this FTP APK&lt;/a>
(not affiliated, and I make no guarantees about availability or functionality)
and it worked pretty well.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-ftp-server">The FTP Server&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>FTP is an old protocol that allows files to get shared over a network.
You can pull files from the remote server or push files to it,
depending on permissions. We&amp;rsquo;re going to be pulling the purchased media.
If you&amp;rsquo;re using the APK I linked above, there are some configuration
steps. Make sure the tablet is connected to WiFi and that you know
the tablet&amp;rsquo;s IP (Settings -&amp;gt; Network, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure specifically).&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="server-configuration">Server Configuration&lt;/h4>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Click on the Settings cog in the app.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create new server, give it a name (the name doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click the Users tab at the top of the app.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a new user. Both the username and the password are arbitrary
but make sure you remember them because you will need it later. Leave
the Document Root as &lt;code>/&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Save the user and server settings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Back at the main page of the app, click Start to run the server.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="the-ftp-client">The FTP Client&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Now that the tablet is running a server, you need to download an FTP
client on your computer. For Macs, I really enjoy using &lt;a href="https://cyberduck.io">CyberDuck&lt;/a>. On Windows, you can use &lt;a href="https://filezilla-project.org">FileZilla&lt;/a>. Again, no affiliations or guarantees about these products. Get one
downloaded and let&amp;rsquo;s configure it together.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="client-configuration">Client Configuration&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Remember the username and password you set in the server on the tablet
above. You&amp;rsquo;ll need them here. Also get the tablet IP if you didn&amp;rsquo;t before.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Connect to a new host. This is the IP from the tablet. The server
should also have generated a random port number. Put that in the Port
portion of the connection settings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enter the username and password from the server settings in their places too.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click Quick Connect, and you should be given a file tree in the
connection window.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h4 id="getting-the-files">Getting The Files&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The tablet uses that memory module as a virtual SD card, and it&amp;rsquo;s
accessible a few places. I found it easiest in &lt;code>/storage/sdcard/&lt;/code>.
Here are all of the internal media like Music, Pictures, Mail, etc.
Right click whichever folder you want to download and click the Download
option in the context menu. The network speeds on this device are not
fast, so be patient as they download.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-conclusion">The Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is a pretty weird device without a lot of documentation out on
the internet. I hope that this guide can show up in more searches when
other folks go digging for information on the JP5 Mini.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Python_none</title><link>https://williamgeorgecook.com/posts/python_none/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2022 20:01:56 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://williamgeorgecook.com/posts/python_none/</guid><description>Pythonic None Today at work we had a silly bug that exposes how reliant I am on Go&amp;rsquo;s type system and compiler.

&lt;p>Today at work we had a silly bug that exposes how reliant I am on Go&amp;rsquo;s type system and compiler. I personally am too comfortable building a Docker image and assuming that the most egregious bugs were caught simply because the build was successful.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-bug">The Bug&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Python doesn&amp;rsquo;t require you to specify a return value. In fact, you can have a function that may not explicitly return at all. Since Python is a scripting language, it will automatically return when it hits the bottom of the function being called. When this happens without returning a specific value, any variable assigned to the function call will be &lt;code>None&lt;/code>. A silly but illustrating example:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code class="language-code=" data-lang="code=">def change_string(do_it: bool) -&amp;gt; str:
if do_it:
return &amp;#34;changed!&amp;#34;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This function accepts a boolean that determines whether to do anything at all. According to the type hints and the function name, a string is the expected return type. You can assign the output of this function to a variable like normal:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code class="language-code=" data-lang="code=">my_string = change_string(False)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>However, since the argument to &lt;code>change_string&lt;/code> is &lt;code>False&lt;/code>, the assignment will suffer from this bug. There is no return statement for a fasly &lt;code>do_it&lt;/code> condition, so when Python reaches the end of the function it will have no choice but to return &lt;code>None&lt;/code>. You can confirm the assignment by printing the value and type of &lt;code>my_string&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code class="language-code=" data-lang="code=">print(my_string)
print(type(my_string))
&amp;gt; None
&amp;gt; &amp;lt;class &amp;#39;NoneType&amp;#39;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;h2 id="lesson-learned">Lesson Learned&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We switched to Go for the concurrency benefits but also the type system and compiler helps save us from these runtime errors. The same function in Go would result in a compile time error:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code class="language-code=" data-lang="code=">func changeString(doIt bool) string {
if doIt {
return &amp;#34;Changed!&amp;#34;
}
}
func main() {
s := changeString(false)
fmt.Println(s)
}
&amp;gt; go run main.go
&amp;gt; ./main.go:10:1: missing return
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This Python service isn&amp;rsquo;t a candidate for rewriting in Go any time soon. Remembering to be more thorough in my code review and testing would have saved me from an embarrassing run time error that had some client impact today.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
