# Why Go?
This is less a blog post and more a repository for my slides. 

## Background
I gave this talk on December 18th 2024 at the [Orlando Devs](https://orlandodevs.com) Holiday Party. 

## Some Notes
As these are just the slides, you're going to miss most of the content of the talk. But know
that this is a very cursory introduction to Go. All of what I cover and more can be discovered
on the [Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1). I wholly recommend you spend half an hour
or so to complete that if you are interested in learning more about the Go syntax and features. 

## Following Up
Please reach out if you want to learn more about Go or talk about Go-related things! The best 
way is to [connect with me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wgeorgecook/).

## The Slides
Here are my slides! The Gopher photos in the Mascot slide were taken from the [Go blog](https://go.dev/blog/gopher) and the
backgrounds were made in [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) using [this image](https://scrapbox.io/icons/golang) I found online.
