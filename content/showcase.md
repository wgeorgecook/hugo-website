# Meet Needs

[Meet Needs](https://github.com/wgeorgecook/meetneeds) is a community broker program that allows for basic moderation. Through Meet Needs, people can submit needs they need met with contact information that is only available to the moderator, and the need itself is posted to the community Needs Board. People can volunteer to meet a need, and send their contact information to the moderator. The goal here is for the moderators to verify both need makers and need fulfillers and connect the two parties.
