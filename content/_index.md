# Hello there!

Thank you for stopping by! I'm a full stack lead developer, proficient in Go, Python, and JavaScript (React, mostly and getting better at TypeScript). 
- Current lead developer at [Conquer](conquer.io).
- I can only succeed if my team succeeds. 
- Inclusive, empathetic and understanding.
- Forever a student and always a mentor. 

### Find me on planet Earth
I live in Orlando, Florida with my family. We enjoy all that central Florida has to offer, especially the world class theme parks and access to endless wilderness.
I love tending to my garden and biking around the neighborhood to all of the great parks, shops, and restaurants around me.
If you see me waiting in line for Living With The Land or catching a picture of a swamp puppy, feel free to say hi!
