- I'm a full stack developer, proficient in Go, Python, and JavaScript/TypeScript. 
- I'm a senior developer at Apple.
- I strive to be an inclusive and empathetic leader.
- I will never stop learning and take every opportunity to teach what I know.


### Find me on planet Earth
Catch me around the south and east bay hugging all the good trees that grow up on the coast or in the mountains. I love to bike or walk as much as I can to get around and am always aspiring to be the best gardener I can be.
